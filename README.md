## Installation

### Install nvm

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
```

nvm allows you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node which is
handy when two projects depend on a different Node version.

### Install Node

```
nvm install node
```

While running a React application does not require Node, the development tools
are meant to run in a Node environment.

### Install create-react-app

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

create-react-app is a convenience tool you can use to create blank React
projects that require no build configuration.

### Create a blank React project

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

To start your app in development mode, run:

```
npm start
```

## Components

A React app is a collection of many individual components. A component is a
*visual* building block that serves a particular purpose, such as displaying a
button or a certain web page.

In the long run, it's recommended to split larger components into smaller
ones. Small components are easier to reuse and debug, whereas large components
are challenging to maintain and understand.

## State

Some components have their own internal state that dictates how they should
behave (e.g. whether a dropdown menu should be open or closed).

Avoid duplicating state and, instead, distribute relevant parts of the
state to other components as props.

When you reach a point where many components across your application depend
on a shared state, you should look for a global state management strategy.
[MobX](https://mobx.js.org) is a minimal third-party library that provides a
clean way to create and manage encapsulated stores. React also has a built-in
API called [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) which allows you to
create globally accessible states.

## Props

Components can pass read-only data to child components as props.

You can also pass entire functions to child components. This is useful
when, for example, you want a button component to call the parent
component's save method when clicked.

## Stateful components

Stateful components are classes that have their own keyâ€“value stores.
You can change the state by calling `this.setState` and providing the
key and a new value. The state is readable via `this.state`.

```js
class Dropdown extends Component {
  // Default state
  state = {
    isOpen: false,
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div onClick={() => this.setState({isOpen: true})}>
        {
          this.state.isOpen &&
          <div>
            Dropdown content goes here
          </div>
        }
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

By default, **every state and prop change triggers a re-render**.

Stateful components contain
[lifecycle methods](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle)
or hooks that can be used to influence a component's behavior under certain
conditions. For example, by implementing the lifecycle method
`componentDidMount` you can tell a component to fire an HTTP request on
mount (after loading up the component) that fetches a list of blog posts to be
shown on the page:

```js
...

componentDidMount() {
  this.fetchBlogPosts()
}

fetchBlogPosts = async () => {
  this.setState({
    isLoading: true, // render a spinner while this.state.isLoading is true
  })

  const response = await axios.get('https://example.com/api/blog-posts')

  this.setState({
    blogPosts: response.data,
    isLoading: false,
  })
}

render() {
  ...
}

...
```

## Stateless components

Stateless components, also referred to as dumb components, are essentially just
render functions that take any number of props as arguments and return JSX
(markup). They do not have their own state so their behavior is solely
influenced by props.

```js
// Here, the 'type' prop is given a default value of 'button'
const Button = ({type = 'button', onClick, label}) =>
  <button type={type} onClick={onClick}>
    {label}
  </button>

...

<Button label="Click Me" onClick={() => window.alert('Hi!')} />
```

## Events

Many elements support built-in [events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
that can be used to interact with your components. Here are some examples:

```js
<input
  type="text"
  value={this.state.username}
  onChange={event => this.setState({username: event.target.value})}
/>
```

```js
<button onClick={() => this.save()}>
  Save
</button>
```

```js
<form onSubmit={event => {
  event.preventDefault()
  
  this.save()
}}>
  ...
  <button type="submit">
    Save
  </button>
</form>
```

## Common rendering patterns

### Conditional rendering

Render a spinner while `this.state.isLoading` is true:

```js
<div>
  {
    this.state.isLoading &&
    <Spinner />
  }
</div>
```

Remember to convert truthy/falsy values into proper booleans, because otherwise
React will render the values themselves!

```js
<div>
  {
    Boolean(this.state.blogPosts.length) &&
    <ul>
      ...
    </ul>
  }
</div>
```

### Lists of items

Iterate over an array of items with `Array.prototype.map`:

```js
<div>
  {
    this.state.blogPosts.map(blogPost =>
      <article key={blogPost.id}>
        <h2>{blogPost.title}</h2>
        <div>{blogPost.body}</div>
      </article>
    )
  }
</div>
```

Every iteratee needs a unique `key` prop to allow React to figure out which
item (not) to update during the next re-render.

## styled-components

[styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com) is a helper
library that provides a convenient interface for styling your React
components in plain JavaScript, outputting presentational React
components.

The CSS rules are written inside template literals (backticks) allowing
you to write any JavaScript expressions like variables and function
calls. Styled components can be extended and referenced by other styled
components.

```js
import styled from 'styled-components'
import {PRIMARY_COLOR, SECONDARY_COLOR} from './styles/colors'

const Button = styled.button`
  padding: 20px;
  transition: transform 100ms;

  &:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
  }
`

const PrimaryButton = styled(Button)`
  background-color: ${PRIMARY_COLOR};
  border: none;
  color: ${SECONDARY_COLOR};
`

...

<PrimaryButton onClick={() => window.alert('Hi!')}>
  Click Me
</PrimaryButton>
```

## Modern JavaScript

### const vs let

Always prefer `const`. Use `let` if absolutely necessary.

`const` is better because it disallows variable reassignment and reduces
unnecessary side effects.

### Array spread

Array spread syntax merges arrays.

```js
const girls = ['Tiffany', 'Wendy', 'Alice']
const boys = ['Caleb', 'Tim', 'Rick']

// Now let's merge both arrays into one
const everyone = [
  ...girls,
  ...boys,
]
```

### Object spread

Object spread syntax merges/overrides objects.

```js
const personal = {
  name: 'Wendy McDuff',
  email: 'wendy@example.com',
}

const social = {
  twitter: 'wendymcduff',
  facebook: 'wendy.mcduff',
  instagram: 'wendywendy',
}

// Now let's pull them all into a single object
const profile = {
  ...personal,
  ...social,
}
```

### Implicitly returning functions

Without curly braces, arrow functions will by default return whatever comes
after the arrow.

The following functions produce the same output:

```js
const sayHi = () => 'Hi!'

const sayHi = () => {
  return 'Hi!'
}
```

However, if you want to implicitly return an **object**, you'll need to
remember to wrap the object in parentheses:

```js
const giveMeAnObject = () => ({
  foo: 'bar',
})

// Which is equivalent to:

const giveMeAnObject = () => {
  return {
    foo: 'bar',
  }
}
```

### Async/await

`async/await` functions are a more convenient way to use `Promise`s.
Internally, they still behave as promises and are fully compatible with other
non-`async/await` functions that return `Promise`s.

```js
const fetchBlogPosts = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('https://example.com/api/blog-posts')

  return response.data
}
```

You can call `async` functions anywhere in your code, but you always need to
declare a function as an `async` function if you want to use the `await`
keyword.

## Immutability

Instead of modifying existing objects and arrays, try to create new copies.
Spread syntax is great because it only reads the inputs and returns completely
new values. `Array.prototype.map` and `Array.prototype.filter` also produce
new values, without touching the original arrays.

The main problem with mutations is that changing the shape of existing things
can solve your immediate problem but it can break other parts of the
application without your knowing it.

## Routing

Routing lets you split your app into separate page components based on the
requested URL path. For example, you can render a Home component at `/` and a
Blog component at `/blog`.

[react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/basic) is
the de facto routing framework for React.

To enable app-wide routing, define your routes in your root (top-most)
component:

```js
import React, {Fragment} from 'react'
import {BrowserRouter, Switch, Route} from 'react-router-dom'

const Router = () =>
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
      <Route path="/blog" component={Blog} />
      <Route path="/blog/:id" component={BlogPost} />
      <Route component={NotFound} />
    </Switch>
  </BrowserRouter>
```

`Switch` ensures that only one of the enclosed route components gets mounted at
a time.

Having a colon in a route (e.g. `/blog/:id`) forwards the wildcard `id` to the
component as `this.props.match.params.id` so that you are able to fetch a blog
post by that ID.

The last `Route` entry without a path is a fallback route which usually works
as a 404 page.

Having `BrowserRouter` as the routing adapter requires that the web server
(e.g. Amazon S3/CloudFront) be capable of serving the same `index.html` entry
point regardless of path: `https://example.com/foo/bar` should serve
`https://example.com/index.html`. If your web server does not support it, you
can replace `BrowserRouter` with `HashRouter` which prefixes paths with `/#/`.

You can link to these routes with the `Link` component:

```js
import {Link} from 'react-router-dom'

...

<Link to="/blog">Check out my blog</Link>
```

## Container components

Container components are just an architectural concept referring to any
stateful component that has a "master"-like responsibility.

A container component typically holds data and methods which it delegates to
child components to form a coherent unit, like a single web page.

In our previous routing example, the `Home` page component could be seen as a
container component that's in charge of maintaining the home page related state
and then combining smaller components to make up the actual page.

To avoid state duplication, the container component's state is the single
source of truth that gets distributed to child components.

## HTTP requests

A React app is often just a hollow front-end client so it needs to fetch
content (e.g. blog posts) from somewhere. Since web browsers are built around
HTTP, we can use the very same protocol to transfer information between a React
app and back-end services.

We prefer to use [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for HTTP requests
because it's simpler and more convenient than using the native
[`fetch` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
directly.

This is how you'd `GET` a list of blog posts from a hypothetical RESTful API
and show them in a list:

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react'
import axios from 'axios'

class BlogPosts extends Component {
  state = {
    blogPosts: [],
  }

  fetchBlogPosts = async () => {
    const response = await axios.get('https://example.com/api/blog-posts')

    this.setState({blogPosts: response.data})
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.fetchBlogPosts()
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <ul>
        {
          this.state.blogPosts.map(
            blogPost => <li key={blogPost.id}>{blogPost.title}</li>
          )
        }
      </ul>
    )
  }
}
```

## Type safety with TypeScript

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language and does not provide a way to ensure
variables are of the correct type before executing the code. This means that
mistakenly giving a wrong input value to a function will go unnoticed until you
or somebody else encounters a glitch.

The main advantage to having a statically typed language, therefore, is that it
notifies you of type errors as you're coding. It also lets you inspect the
shape of data structures and functions that are being used, serving as a form
of self-documentation as well.

To benefit from such features, you can choose to write your source code in
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), a statically typed language
designed to augment the dynamic nature of JavaScript. It transpiles your code
into regular JavaScript that runs in browsers and other JavaScript-powered
environments.

To scaffold a blank TypeScript-based React project, run:

```
npx create-react-app my-app --typescript
```

For example, you can declare a strict interface for a component's prop
and state structure:

```tsx
import React, {Component} from 'react'

type Value = string | number

interface Option {
  name: string,
  value: Value,
}

interface Props {
  defaultValue?: Value, // ? makes this property optional
  options: Array<Option>,
  onSelect: (option: Option) => void,
}

interface State {
  isOpen: boolean,
}

class Dropdown extends Component<Props, State> {
  state = {
    isOpen: false,
  }

  render() {
    const {isOpen} = this.state

    const selectedOption = this.props.options.find(option => option.value === this.props.defaultValue)
    
    const titleText = selectedOption ? selectedOption.name : 'Please select...'

    return (
      <div>
        {
          isOpen
            ? <ul>
              {
                this.props.options.map(
                  option =>
                    <li
                      key={option.value}
                      onClick={() => {
                        this.props.onSelect(option)
                        this.setState({isOpen: false})
                      }}
                    >
                      {option.name}
                    </li>
                )
              }
            </ul>
            : <span onClick={() => this.setState({isOpen: true})}>{titleText}</span>
        }
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Giving the component an incompatible set of props immediately notifies you of
the inconsistency and urges you to fix the issue.

## MobX

As your app grows in complexity, it often becomes challenging and cumbersome to
maintain the entire application state inside individual components and pass bits
and pieces of it to child components.

[MobX](https://mobx.js.org) is a third-party library that enables you to
declare self-contained data stores for your React application. Instead of
passing states down the component tree, you can simply import a MobX store into
a React component and read and write values directly without having to tap into
the prop chain.

A MobX store is a plain JavaScript class that consists of MobX-decorated
instance variables and methods. The class is immediately instantiated and
exported within the class file itself so that importing the store always gives
a reference to the same exact store instance, and not a new instance each time.

Example:

```js
// blogStore.js

import axios from 'axios'
import {observable} from 'mobx'

class BlogStore {
  @observable posts = []
  @observable isFetching = false

  fetchPosts = async () => {
    this.isFetching = true

    const response = await axios.get('https://example.com/api/blog-posts')

    this.posts = response.data // here we update the state simply by assigning a new value
    this.isFetching = false // another state change
  }
}

export default new BlogStore() // singleton
```

The `@observable` decorator marks an instance variable as a MobX state value
which can then be observed by React components.

```js
// Blog.js

import React, {Component} from 'react'
import {observer} from 'mobx-react'

import blogStore from './blogStore.js'

@observer // this decorator tells the React component to listen for MobX state changes
class Blog extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    blogStore.fetchPosts()
  }

  render() {
    if (blogStore.isFetching) {
      return <span>Loading...</span>
    }

    return (
      <section>
        {
          blogStore.posts.map(post =>
            <article key={post.id}>
              <h2>{post.title}</h2>
              <p>{post.teaser}</p>
            </article>
          )
        }
      </section>
    )
  }
}
```

The easiest way to try out MobX is to create a blank TypeScript project with
the latest version of create-react-app:

```
npx create-react-app my-app --typescript
```

Then add these lines to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "lib": ["dom", "es2015"],
  "experimentalDecorators": true
}
```

And finally install MobX and the MobX utility library for React:

```
npm install mobx mobx-react
```

Please note that your source files will also require a `.tsx` file extension
(TypeScript with support for JSX syntax).

## API abstraction

When interfacing with an external API it's highly recommended that you create
your own front-end wrapper around the API. This comes with a number of
benefits:

- Easy to switch base URLs based on the current environment (e.g. production)
- Easy to factor in authentication logic
- Easy to mock endpoints while the real endpoints are still being developed
- Easy to reuse and cache data
- All API endpoints are conveniently located inside the wrapper

Here's a simplified example of an API wrapper:

```js
// api.js

import axios from 'axios'

import Authentication from './Authentication'
import Blog from './Blog'

class Api {
  constructor(baseUrl) {
    this.baseUrl = baseUrl

    // Group endpoints into cohesive modules
    this.authentication = new Authentication(this)
    this.blog = new Blog(this)
  }

  // This is an HTTP request helper that can be reused by all API modules
  request = async ({method, endpoint, data, requiresAuthToken = false, headers = {}}) => {
    if (requiresAuthToken && this.authentication.isAuthenticated()) {
      headers.authorization = `Bearer ${this.authentication.accessToken.value}`
    }

    const url = `${this.baseUrl}${endpoint}`
    
    const response = await axios({url, method, data})

    return response.data
  }
}

export default new Api(process.env.apiBaseUrl)
```

```js
// Authentication.js

class Authentication {
  constructor(api) {
    this.api = api
  }

  isAuthenticated = () => {
    return this.accessToken ? this.accessToken.expiresAt > +new Date() : false
  }

  login = async (email, password) => {
    try {
      const accessToken = await this.api.request({
        method: 'post',
        endpoint: '/auth/login',
        data: {email, password},
      })

      this.accessToken = accessToken
    } catch (e) {
      window.alert('Access denied')
    }
  }

  logout = () => {
    this.authToken = undefined
  }

  sleep = (durationMs) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, durationMs))
}

export default Authentication
```

```js
// Blog.js

class Blog {
  constructor(api) {
    this.api = api
  }

  fetchPostById = async (id) => {
    const post = await this.api.request({method: 'get', endpoint: `/blog/${id}`})

    return post
  }

  createPost = async (title, body) => {
    // This endpoint is still being worked on by the back-end developer so
    // we'll just go ahead and mock the endpoint for our own convenience.
    // Once the real endpoint is completed we can modify this helper and
    // send the request to the real endpoint.

    await this.api.sleep(1000) // simulate a 1-second delay

    return {
      id: 12345,
      title,
      body,
    }
  }

  postComment = async (blogPostId, comment) => {
    await this.api.request({
      method: 'post',
      endpoint: `/blog/${blogPostId}/comment`,
      requiresAuthToken: true,
      data: comment,
    })
  }
}

export default Blog
```

Use the API wrapper inside a React component:

```jsx
import React, {Component} from 'react'

import api from './api'

class BlogPost extends Component {
  state = {
    post: undefined,
  }
  
  componentDidMount() {
    const {id} = this.props.match.params

    this.fetchPostById(id)
  }

  fetchPostById = async (id) => {
    const post = await api.blog.fetchPostById(id)

    this.setState({post})
  }

  render() {
    ...
  }
}
```
